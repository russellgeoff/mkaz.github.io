A site by [Marcus Kazmierczak](https://mkaz.com) focused on technology, code and the like. I'm a strong believer in open source and the power it has to improve the world in terms of more reliable, secure, and transparent software; but also in democratizing technology and knowledge making it available to everyone.

### Professional

I work at [Automattic](https://automattic.com/), purveyor of fine web services such as [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com) and [Akismet](https://akismet.com). My title is Tinkerer on a team which is a bit of R&D and new product development. I get to build on interesting technology and attempt to solve problems and push things forward.

Previously, I was the founding engineer at a start-up called Mayaâ€™s Mom. Our company was acquired by [BabyCenter](https://babycenter.com/). I continued working for BabyCenter as VP of Engineering, leading the engineering team developing new features and services for millions of moms around the world.

I worked briefly at CNET as a consultant on the Haystack storage project, which was a massive storage solution for the Webshots photo sharing site. We basically built a closed Amazon S3 system a month or two prior to Amazon, they smartly did an open service.

I cut my technical chops at [E-TRADE Financial](https://etrade.com) for many years during the go-go dotcom days. I worked in the Architecture group on problems such as site scalability and performance. I also led the embracing of open source and converting the data center to Linux and open services such as Apache and Tomcat, which were radical ideas back then.


### Personal

I live in the Bay Area with my wife and two daughters. I'm an avid photographer, check out my personal site at [mkaz.com](https://mkaz.com/) to see [my photo blog](https://mkaz.com/category/photography/photo-blog/) and [galleries](https://mkaz.com/category/photography/gallery/) of my work. Plus I write various articles about technique and [camera hacking](https://mkaz.com/2005/01/08/homemade-lenses/) that I've done.
