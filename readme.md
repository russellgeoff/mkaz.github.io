A code and solutions focused site by Marcus Kazmierczak. Where I publish various articles, tips and other developer focused content to help myself remember and hopefully help others.

Please feel free to submit pull request if you see any issues, all articles are in `_posts` directory. A lot of this content is old from sits and blogs of yesteryear; so it might be dated and may no longer apply to the always changing technology world.
