I previously wrote about <a href="https://mkaz.com/2011/01/14/why-microsoft-onenote-kicks-so-much-note-taking-ass/">how wonderful OneNote</a> is, I still think it mostly holds true, but I’ve switched to Evernote. Both are relatively complex and if you’re looking for a simple easy way to take and sync notes, use <a href="http://simplenote.com/">Simplenote</a>.


I'm working on new project about the <a href="http://siliconvalley.town/">history of Silicon Valley</a> which requires a fair amount of research, collecting notes and organizing lots of different information.

The biggest difference between the three note apps are how they organize notes.  Simplenote as it names implies is simple, no folders, just a list of notes.  Evernote has two layers, notebooks and notes inside. OneNote has three layers, notebooks, sections and notes.

OneNote excelled for me at my last company, which I ran engineering and was involved in lots of different projects, managing a large team and lots and lots of meetings. OneNote's three layers of organization made it great to create a “Project” section and in there organize different sets of notes like Meetings, Budget or Mocks.

With a change in my usage, the extra layer made things a bit more complex.  OneNote has a couple of usability issues between platforms. I actually ended up deleting an entire section trying to rename it and lost a dozen notes by accident, not even a confirmation prompt or being able to restore.

The biggest feature that got me to switch to Evernote is the ability to capture web clippings. I can do research and start capturing relevant pages without resorting to copy and pasting URLs, which then need to be clicked to see the information. Web clipping saves the web page within Evernote, making it easily browsable and searchable.

Here are a few common tips I’ve gathered, like most things I write, I’m documenting these for myself, but publish it out to possibly help others.

#### Global Shortcuts

```
Ctrl-Cmd-v — paste to evernote
Ctrl-Cmd-c — clip (screen grab) to evernote
Ctrl-Cmd-e — search evernote
```

#### Shortcuts within Evernote

```
Cmd-j — jump between notebooks
Shift-Cmd-t — insert a to-do checkbox
Cmd-k — add html link
```

#### Note Links

You can create cross links within Evernote, so link one note to another like a wiki. To create a note link use the “Note” menu or `ctrl-opt-cmd-c` and then paste the link where you want. <a href="https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2011/10/21/did-you-know-note-links-and-how-to-use-them/">#</a>


#### Email to Evernote

A new feature to me is the ability to forward emails to Evernote, to find your unique email address go to “Account Info” menu.  I’m just starting to use this featured, but emailing notes can be useful to collect receipts, activation codes, confirmations or other useful info. <a href="https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2015/01/06/email-content-evernote/">#</a>
