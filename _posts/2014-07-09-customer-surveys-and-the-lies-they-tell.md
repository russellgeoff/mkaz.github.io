In the past few years I've traded in and purchased two new cars, because kids. Each time the process was pretty much the same, long and arduous. For our minivan it took about 6 hours total, and for the most recent sedan it took 3 hours.

It took shorter the second time because I asked them to start the appraisal process before I did any test drives or even started talking. It was in my opening hello.

Them: &#8220;Hi, how can we help you today?"

Me: &#8220;I want to buy a new car and trading in this car, let's start the appraisal process now."

However, each time, after negotiating and deciding on a final price for both trade-in and new car purchase it still took another 90 minutes to complete the transaction. This is the part that absolutely baffles me. There is nothing to do but draw up paperwork, sign and be done. Once I get into the finance guys office it is all done in 15 minutes. I have no idea what happens in the dead 75 minutes between.

The Salesman says its nothing he can do and apologizes its taking too long, he's my buddy.

At the end of it, all paperwork signed and I finally get the keys; the Salesman takes me out to the car and shows me the other features. This is when he lays on the story about I should get a call from headquarters asking how everything went today and Honda really looks down on anything that is not 5-stars. So if you could answer everything with 5-stars, that'd be great.

So, the Salesman has been my guy throughout the day, making sure I'm comfortable, making sure I'm taken care of, etc. It's always the Manager or someone else causing the delays. So now I don't want to give my guy a bad review.

So two days later, when I got the call from Honda, sure enough I give them 5-star reviews. The dealership was great, no problems. Pleasure doing business with them. I'd recommend them.

There are a few other reasons I give them 5-stars for everything. First, the person on the phone wants me to give 5-stars, otherwise they'll have to ask follow-up questions and elaborate. I really don't want to elaborate on the survey, I just want to finish it so they can check my name off and not call me again.

Secondly, I think if I don't give them 5-stars they may try to follow up with me later to help me. I don't have any problems and don't need help, beyond not wanting to spend six hours at a dealership to buy a car.

Thirdly, I don't think there is any way my answers on this survey will have any effect on the car sales process. Saturn attempted to sell cars differently, they failed. Tesla is in lawsuits galore about trying to change the car buying process. Do I really think my 5-minute survey is going to change that, nope. So why trouble myself to be honest, just answer the questions and get off the phone.

So now, what did Honda learn from that customer survey? Absolutely nothing, but everyone involved sure feels better about themselves. The dealership can brag about posting up 5-star reviews, and HQ feels happy that everything is just humming along fine. Stick head back in sand.

My point of the article is not that buying a car sucks, everyone knows it does. The point is look at why are you asking customers for feedback and surveys. How are you using what they give you, is it really to solve a problem, or is it to judge how your doing?

If you are really want to know, dog food it. If I were Honda and wanted to know how the car buying process is, I'd send the people making phone surveys and have them go out and buy cars from dealerships and see what it's like. Though this might take them too much time.
