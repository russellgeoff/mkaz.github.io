Tonight I needed over 40 pts out of Steven Jackson to move into second place in my fantasy league. Obviously, it didn't happen so I ended up in third which is still in the playoffs and I play the same team either way. But it got me thinking what was the best fantasy day by any player. Here's what I found.

In recent times, when people were actually playing fantasy football:

* Jerry Rice (WR San Francisco 49ers) - Oct 14, 1990 vs. Atlanta - <strong>41 pts</strong>, 5 receiving TDs, 225 yds

* Clinton Portis (RB Denver Broncos) - Dec 7, 2003 vs. Kansas City - <strong>41 pts</strong>, 5 rushing TDs, 218 yds rushing, 33 yds receiving

* Shaun Alexander (RB Seattle Seahawks) - Sept 30, 2002 vs. Minnesota - <strong>40 pts</strong>, 5 rushing TDs, 139 yds rushing, 92 yds receiving

* Peyton Manning (QB Indianapolis Colts) - Nov 25, 2004 vs. Detroit Lions - <strong>40 pts</strong>, 6 passing TDs, 236 yds passing

Prior to fantasy football, plus multi-talented players:

* Gale Sayers (RB Chicago Bears) - Dec 12, 1965 vs. San Francisco - <strong>45 pts</strong>, 5 rushing TDs, 1 receiving TD, 1 punt return TD, 113 rushing yds, 89 receiving yds

* Dub Jones (RB Cleveland Browns) - Nov 25, 1951 vs. Chicago Bears - <strong>Minimum 43 pts</strong>, 4 rushing TDs, 2 receiving TDs.  I couldn't find total yards but he had the following yards just from his touchdowns: 83 yds rushing, 77yds

* Cookie Gilchrist (RB Buffalo Bills) - Dec 8, 1963 vs. NY Jets - <strong>42 pts</strong>
5 rushing TDs, 243 rushing yds

And probably the greatest fantasy day in NFL history is incomplete. Ernie Nevers (RB, K - Chicago Cardinals) on Nov 28th, 1929 vs. Chicago Bears rushed for 6 TDs and kicked 4 extra points. (He missed two) Unfortunately, I can not find how many yards he rushed for so I can't complete his score. <strong>Minimum 40 pts</strong>

<div><small><strong>Scoring Note:</strong> My league gives 6 pts per touchdown, 1 pt per 20 yds rushing, 1 pt per 20 yds receiving, 1 pt per 50 yds passing. </small></div>
