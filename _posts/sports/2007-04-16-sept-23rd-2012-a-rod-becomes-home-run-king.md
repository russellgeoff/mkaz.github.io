Following up on [my previous article](/home-run-kings-barry-bonds-a-rod-and-pujols/) with the prediction, Alex Rodriquez will become the all time home run leader with his 760th home run on Sept 23rd, 2012. He'll pass Barry Bonds' mark of 759 home runs also set on Sept 23rd, 5 years previous.

Prediction for A-Rod's next five seasons leading up to the record:
