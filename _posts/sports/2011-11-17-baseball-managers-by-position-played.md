Mike Matheny, a former catcher, was just named manager of the St. Louis Cardinals. This got me thinking, knowing that Bruce Bochy and Joe Girardi were both former catchers, what's the distribution of former positions of MLB managers.

It turns out catchers are by far the most popular former position for a manager, with ten of the twenty eight managers being  former catchers. I was surprised there are only two pitchers.
