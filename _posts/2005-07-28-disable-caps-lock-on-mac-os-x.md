By far the most frustrating key on the keyboard has to be CAPS LOCK. *Does any one ever use this key!?* After many years of accidentally pressing it, I finally stumbled upon the way to disable it.

  1. Go to ` System Preferences ` 
  2. Click ` Keyboard ` preference pane 
  3. Click `Modifier Keys.. ` button 
  4. Change ` Caps Lock Key ` to ` No Action `

These are updated instructions for Mac OS X Mavericks, previous versions are very similar. Preference pane names and location of buttons have changed, but the &#8220;Modifier Keys" and setting to No Action is the same.

I do not think these instructions work in versions previous to Mac OS X 10.4, also known as Tiger. If you are looking for how to do it in older versions, take a look at [uControl][1].
