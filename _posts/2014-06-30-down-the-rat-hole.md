I wake up early each morning, to enjoy a cup of coffee and get a little work in maybe on a side project or learn something new a little me time before my girls get up. I'll first read Hacker News, Twitter or whatever to get focused and wake up before jumping into coding.

Here's a typical scenario, &#8220;Hey checkout it out a guy built his own weather station at home. This looks pretty interesting. Oh look a few links on the equipment he is using.&#8221; Down the rat hole we go.

Wow, this looks pretty cool, a bit of a challenge but I can do this! Plus I have a Raspberry Pi laying around after reading that article about the guy who built that something or other. It is just waiting for a project to do and weather is cool, I like to know the temperature!

At this point, I'm doing research on weather sensors that work with the Pi. Checking out other projects people have built, wireless sensors for indoor and outdoor use. Yes! I can build a web app which charts the difference between outside and inside temperatures and display on that small LCD screen I never used. I forget what project that was for.

Oh, look I can buy these on Amazon and since I have Prime, its just $4 to get them tomorrow and I can build and prep everything and be ready to hookup. Once I have my own weather stations setup, I can feed that data to Weather Underground and maybe even local news. I could become *the* expert for hyper-local weather, I can track it for years and create difference charts, graphs, cool maps.

This is going to be awesome!

Now, typically the girls wake up about this time. I get their breakfast going, read a Frozen book or three. By the time I make it back to my computer most of the enthusiasm fades. Sometimes things get ordered, maybe I buy a domain or two. Most of the time these crazy one off projects don't amount to much. I'll wish I spent that time on something a little more productive.

I don't quite understand the psychology behind it, and I'm not really sure I want to change. I end up with a wider range of knowledge and who knows I might hit upon something really cool next time!
