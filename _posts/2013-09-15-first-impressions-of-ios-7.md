I was really curious and a bit impatient to try out iOS 7 and saw this artcile on LifeHacker on [how to upgrade to iOS 7][1] right now. So instead of waiting a week to get the official upgrade, I tried my luck at downloading random software.

<a href="http://ebeab.com/2013/09/15/first-impressions-of-ios-7/photo-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-611"><img src="https://mkaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo-2.jpg?w=169" alt="home screen" width="169" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-611" /></a>

The install went without a hitch, and I have to say I am pretty impressed with the upgrade. After reading the initial critiques and seeing some screen grabs, I was prepared to really dislike it. 

However, it's pretty darn good, not sure I'd say the icons look great, but they aren't bad at all. Now when I see an older designed icon, such as the Yahoo Baseball, they look really out of place and a bit dated.

The overall OS feels good and usable, lots of small niceties added such as the heads up Control Center when you swipe from the bottom. This gives quick access to the flashlight, timer, calculator and camera apps. Plus the ability to toggle common features and control the music.

Similarly, swiping down from the top gives a calendar and day view which reminds me a touch of Google Now, but not nearly as complete. If apps can start filling this in and making up for the lacking &#8220;cards&#8221; then it could be quite usable. Even as just quick access to calendar is nice.

The OS is a good improvement, but not perfect. My minor gripes are its a little too swoopy, lots of animation between screens and apps. It is only a few milliseconds but it does introduce a slight delay. 

Likewise with the way folders work, they open into a whole new screen which needs to swoop in and out, which becomes annoying. I previously had all my apps on the home screen in folders. I switched and took them out of folders and use the screens to navigate.

All in and all, its a refreshing upgrade and after about a week using it, I feel it has a good design aesthetic and better functionality, just needs to cut back a little on superfluous animations.
