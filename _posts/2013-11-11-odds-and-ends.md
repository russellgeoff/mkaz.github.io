I started using [Editorially][1] for creating my last few blog posts and like it. Editorially is a writing tool with a super simple interface, really easy to use and lets you focus on just the writing. Editorially connects properly to WordPress using the API, a few similar tools store passwords which is highly insecure; don’t ever give out your password to third-parties.

I discovered [Teux Deux][2], a new todo list tool which is quite different than others I’ve tried. Teux Deux combines a week calendar and task list in a unique and very useful way to both plan and track tasks. I’m still in the 30-day window, but at only $24/yr I’ll probably be signing up two accounts one for home and work. Plus they have a nice capture area for future ideas/tasks.

I’ve been doing some blog cleaning and out of it came switching my personal site to a clean landing page, check it out at [mkaz.com][3]. Shoutout to my co-worker [JR Tashjian][4] for the design, I borrowed heavily from his [Gravatar Profile site][5]. 

If you are looking to make a similar about.me landing page using WordPress.com, another co-worker Nick Momrik has a tutorial on [how to make an about.me style home page][6].
